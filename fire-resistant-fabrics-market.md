<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Resistant Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inherent Fire-resistant Fabrics</li><li>Treated Fire-resistant Fabrics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire-resistant fabrics are classified into two main types: inherent fire-resistant fabrics and treated fire-resistant fabrics.</p><p>Inherent fire-resistant fabrics are materials that are naturally resistant to flames and do not require any additional treatment to provide fire protection. These fabrics are made using fibers that are inherently flame retardant.</p><p>Treated fire-resistant fabrics, on the other hand, are regular fabrics that have been treated with flame-retardant chemicals to enhance their fire-resistant properties. These treatments create a protective barrier that prevents the fabric from catching fire easily.</p></p>
