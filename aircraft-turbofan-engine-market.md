<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Turbofan Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Bypass Type</li><li>Low-Bypass Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft turbofan engine market is divided into two main types based on bypass ratio - high-bypass type and low-bypass type. High-bypass type engines have a larger fan diameter compared to the core engine, resulting in a higher bypass ratio and increased fuel efficiency. These engines are typically used in commercial airliners. On the other hand, low-bypass type engines have a smaller fan diameter and lower bypass ratio, making them more suitable for military aircraft and smaller commercial jets where higher thrust-to-weight ratio is required.</p></p>
