<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aprotic Solvents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dipolar Aprotic Solvent</li><li>Inert Solvent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aprotic solvents can be categorized into two main types, dipolar aprotic solvents and inert solvents. Dipolar aprotic solvents have a high dipole moment and do not have acidic hydrogen atoms, making them suitable for various chemical reactions such as nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions. In contrast, inert solvents are non-reactive and do not participate in chemical reactions, making them ideal for dissolving and diluting compounds without interfering with the reaction. Both types of aprotic solvents play essential roles in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and electronics.</p></p>
