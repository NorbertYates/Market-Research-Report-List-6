<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LBO Crystal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Type</li><li>Uncoated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LBO crystals are commonly available in two market types: coated and uncoated. Coated type LBO crystals are covered with a thin layer of coating for improved durability and performance in high-power laser applications. On the other hand, uncoated type LBO crystals are untreated and are typically used in lower-power applications where coating is unnecessary. Both types of LBO crystals offer unique advantages depending on the specific needs and requirements of the laser system.</p></p>
