<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon and Energy Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-premise</li><li>Cloud-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon and Energy software can be deployed in two main market types - on-premise and cloud-based. On-premise solutions require the software to be installed on the organization's own physical servers and managed by their IT team. This often provides more control and customization options, but requires higher upfront costs and ongoing maintenance. Cloud-based solutions, on the other hand, are hosted on remote servers and accessed through the internet. This offers easier scalability, lower initial investment, and automatic updates, but may have potential security concerns.</p></p>
