<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Leakage Protector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Voltage Type</li><li>Current Type</li><li>Pulse Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The leakage protector market comprises three main types: voltage type, current type, and pulse type. Voltage-type leakage protectors detect variations in voltage caused by insulation failure, providing a safety mechanism against electric shocks. Current-type protectors monitor differences in electrical current between live and neutral wires, effectively identifying leakage currents. Pulse-type protectors, on the other hand, utilize sharp voltage pulses to identify leakage paths quickly and accurately. Each type serves distinct applications in enhancing electrical safety across residential and industrial sectors.</p></p>
