<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigerator Water Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) Filters</li><li>Carbon Block Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refrigerator water filters primarily fall into two market types: Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filters and Carbon Block filters. GAC filters consist of loose granules of activated carbon, effectively removing contaminants, and providing good flow rates but may have reduced efficiency compared to block filters. Carbon Block filters, on the other hand, utilize a solid block of activated carbon, offering superior filtration and improved contaminant removal due to greater surface area, though with potentially lower flow rates. Both types enhance water quality and taste.</p></p>
