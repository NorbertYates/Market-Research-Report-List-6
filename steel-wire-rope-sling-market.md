<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Wire Rope Sling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ungalvanized</li><li>Galvanized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel wire rope slings are available in two main types - ungalvanized and galvanized. Ungalvanized steel wire rope slings are not treated with a protective coating, making them more susceptible to corrosion. Galvanized steel wire rope slings, on the other hand, are coated with a layer of zinc to enhance their resistance to rust and corrosion. Both types cater to different needs and environments, with galvanized slings being preferred for outdoor or marine applications where moisture and corrosion are major factors.</p></p>
