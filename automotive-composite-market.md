<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Composite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoset</li><li>Thermoplastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive composite market encompasses two primary types: thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermoset composites, known for their enhanced durability and resistance to high temperatures, are widely used in structural components and under-hood applications. They harden irreversibly when cured. In contrast, thermoplastics can be reshaped upon heating, offering advantages like recyclability and shorter production cycles, making them ideal for interior parts and exterior body panels. Both types play crucial roles in weight reduction, fuel efficiency, and performance enhancement in vehicles.</p></p>
