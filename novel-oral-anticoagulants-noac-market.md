<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Novel Oral AntiCoagulants (NOAC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Thrombin Inhibitors</li><li>Direct Factor Xa Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Novel Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) are a type of medication used to prevent blood clots by inhibiting specific factors involved in the clotting process. There are two main types of NOACs: Direct Thrombin Inhibitors and Direct Factor Xa Inhibitors. Direct Thrombin Inhibitors work by blocking the action of thrombin, an enzyme necessary for blood clotting. Direct Factor Xa Inhibitors, on the other hand, target Factor Xa, a protein involved in the clotting cascade. Both types of NOACs are effective in reducing the risk of stroke and other clot-related complications.</p></p>
