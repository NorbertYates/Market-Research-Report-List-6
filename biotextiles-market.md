<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biotextiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-bioabsorbable</li><li>Bioabsorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biotextiles market can be classified into two main types: non-bioabsorbable and bioabsorbable. Non-bioabsorbable biotextiles are designed to remain in the body permanently without being absorbed. They are commonly used in applications such as hernia repair and vascular grafts. On the other hand, bioabsorbable biotextiles are designed to biodegrade over time, allowing for tissue regeneration and eventually being absorbed by the body. They are often used in temporary support structures and scaffolds for tissue engineering.</p></p>
