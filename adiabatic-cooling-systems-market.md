<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adiabatic Cooling Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Air Cooler</li><li>Liquid Cooler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adiabatic cooling systems utilize two main types of cooling methods: dry air coolers and liquid coolers. Dry air coolers use the evaporation of water to cool the air without adding moisture, making them ideal for dry climates. Liquid coolers, on the other hand, use water or another liquid to absorb heat from the surrounding air and then release it through evaporation or a heat exchanger. Both types of cooling systems are efficient and environmentally friendly options for temperature control in various applications.</p></p>
