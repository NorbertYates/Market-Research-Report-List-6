<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Staple Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Absorbable Bone Staple</li><li>Absorbable Bone Staple</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone staple market is divided into two main types: Non-absorbable and absorbable. Non-absorbable bone staples are made of materials like stainless steel or titanium, providing long-term stability and support to fractured bones. Absorbable bone staples, on the other hand, are made of materials like bioresorbable polymers that gradually break down in the body over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove the staple. Both types offer unique benefits depending on the patient's needs and the nature of the injury.</p></p>
