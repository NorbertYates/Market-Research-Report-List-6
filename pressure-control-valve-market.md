<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Control Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Moving Valve</li><li>Pilot Operated Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pressure control valve market includes two main types: the straight moving valve and the pilot-operated valve. Straight moving valves are directly operated by a force and are typically used for smaller flow rates and lower pressures. Pilot-operated valves, on the other hand, use a smaller control valve to operate a larger valve, allowing for precise control of higher flow rates and pressures. Both types of valves play a crucial role in maintaining and adjusting pressure levels in various industrial applications.</p></p>
